# Gallery for an artist called Zorromedsv√§rdet
A very simple website I made as a school assignment for an artist to show off some of their work.
It's mostly filler text, the CSS is a mess and the e-mail form is not fully functional, it doesn't send anything anywhere.

The assignment was graded 'B'.


**Gallery thumbnails seem to be broken after Github-upload**
